#  Learning Dynamic Local Context Representations for Infrared Small Target Detection
Our code is based on [timm](https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models) and [VAN](https://github.com/Visual-Attention-Network).

This is the official repository for our paper, and we will open-source the code once the paper is accepted.
